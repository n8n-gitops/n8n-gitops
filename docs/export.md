# Export Command

The `export` command downloads all workflows from your n8n instance and saves them locally in **mirror mode**.

## Usage

```bash
n8n-gitops export [--externalize-code]
```

## Mirror Mode

The export command operates in **mirror mode**, which means:

✅ **Always exports ALL workflows** from your n8n instance
✅ **Deletes local workflows** that don't exist in n8n
✅ **Deletes orphaned script files** when switching modes
✅ **Updates the manifest** to match remote state exactly

This ensures your local repository is always a perfect mirror of your n8n instance.

## Options

### `--externalize-code`

Extracts inline code from workflow nodes to separate script files.

**Without `--externalize-code` (default):**
```bash
n8n-gitops export
```
- Workflows contain inline code
- All script directories are deleted (if any exist)
- Clean mirror of n8n's native format

**With `--externalize-code`:**
```bash
n8n-gitops export --externalize-code
```
- Code is extracted to `n8n/scripts/`
- Include directives replace inline code
- Better for version control and code review

## Examples

### Basic Export

Export all workflows with inline code:

```bash
n8n-gitops export
```

Result:
```
n8n/
├── workflows/
│   ├── workflow1.json
│   └── workflow2.json
└── manifests/
    └── workflows.yaml
```

### Export with Code Externalization

Export all workflows and externalize code:

```bash
n8n-gitops export --externalize-code
```

Result:
```
n8n/
├── workflows/
│   ├── workflow1.json (contains @@n8n-gitops:include directives)
│   └── workflow2.json
├── scripts/
│   ├── workflow1/
│   │   ├── process_data_pythonCode.py
│   │   └── transform_jsCode.js
│   └── workflow2/
│       └── helper_pythonCode.py
└── manifests/
    └── workflows.yaml
```

### Switching Between Modes

**Scenario:** You previously exported with `--externalize-code`, now want inline code.

```bash
# First export (externalized)
n8n-gitops export --externalize-code
# Creates: n8n/workflows/*.json + n8n/scripts/*/

# Switch to inline code
n8n-gitops export
# Updates: n8n/workflows/*.json (now with inline code)
# Deletes: n8n/scripts/*/ (no longer needed)
```

**Scenario:** You previously exported with inline code, now want externalized.

```bash
# First export (inline)
n8n-gitops export
# Creates: n8n/workflows/*.json (inline code)

# Switch to externalized
n8n-gitops export --externalize-code
# Updates: n8n/workflows/*.json (now with include directives)
# Creates: n8n/scripts/*/ (extracted code)
```

## What Gets Exported

### Workflow Files

Each workflow is saved as a JSON file in `n8n/workflows/`:
- Filename is sanitized from workflow name
- File contains normalized JSON (stable formatting)
- Volatile fields are stripped (id, createdAt, updatedAt, etc.)

### Manifest

The manifest file `n8n/manifests/workflows.yaml` is updated with:
- Workflow names
- File paths (relative to `n8n/`)
- Active state
- Tags

Example:
```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "Payment Processing"
    file: "workflows/payment-processing.json"
    active: true
    tags:
      - production
      - payments
  - name: "Data Sync"
    file: "workflows/data-sync.json"
    active: false
    tags: []
```

### Script Files (with --externalize-code)

Code is extracted from these node fields:
- `pythonCode` → `.py` files
- `jsCode` → `.js` files
- `code` → `.js` files
- `functionCode` → `.js` files

Script file naming:
- Format: `{node-name}_{field-name}.{ext}`
- Example: `Process_Data_pythonCode.py`
- Saved in: `n8n/scripts/{workflow-name}/`

## Mirror Mode Behavior

### Deleting Workflows

If a workflow exists locally but not in n8n:

```bash
n8n-gitops export
```

Output:
```
🗑  Deleting local workflow not in remote: Old Workflow
    → Deleted scripts directory: scripts/Old_Workflow/
```

### Deleting Script Files

When switching from externalized to inline:

```bash
n8n-gitops export  # without --externalize-code
```

Output:
```
🗑  Deleting scripts directory (inline code mode): scripts/workflow1/
🗑  Deleting scripts directory (inline code mode): scripts/workflow2/
```

### Overwriting Files

Script files are always overwritten on re-export (no `_1`, `_2` suffixes):

```bash
# First export
n8n-gitops export --externalize-code
# Creates: Process_Data_pythonCode.py

# Modify code in n8n, then re-export
n8n-gitops export --externalize-code
# Overwrites: Process_Data_pythonCode.py (no Process_Data_pythonCode_1.py)
```
